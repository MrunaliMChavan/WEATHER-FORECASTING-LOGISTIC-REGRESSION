# WEATHER-FORECASTING-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION

The overarching objective of the provided project is to analyze weather data to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. Beginning with data collection and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency, the project proceeds to exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between weather attributes and the target variable, 'RainTomorrow'. 

Subsequently, the project focuses on building a regression model for predicting precipitation levels by selecting relevant features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and utilizing machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes for model training. Evaluation of model performance includes metrics such as accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and others, with grid search employed for hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive accuracy. Cross-validation techniques are applied to assess model robustness, and various evaluation metrics such as R-squared score, mean absolute error, ROC AUC score, and precision-recall curve are computed. 

Ultimately, conclusions are drawn regarding the effectiveness of different classification algorithms for rain prediction, identifying the most suitable models for practical deployment in weather forecasting applications.
