# WEATHER-FORECASTING-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
The project analyzes weather data to forecast rain tomorrow. It employs machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machine, and naive Bayes, alongside evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques, to develop accurate predictive models for practical weather forecasting applications.
